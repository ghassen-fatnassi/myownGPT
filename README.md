# Let's Build GPT: From Scratch

Welcome to the "Let's Build GPT: From Scratch" video series by Andrej Karpathy! In this 2-hour tutorial, you'll learn how to code a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model entirely from scratch, using Python and PyTorch.

## Overview

In this tutorial, Andrej Karpathy guides you through the step-by-step process of building a GPT model from scratch, covering:

- Setting up the development environment.
- Data preprocessing.
- Model architecture.
- Training the model.
- Text generation.
- Evaluation and fine-tuning.
